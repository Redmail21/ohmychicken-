<h2>The story of a <span style="color:red;">CHICKEN</span> with limited jumps in a blocky environment surrounded by a devilish and round CLOWN Try to SURVIVE!</h2>
My second "Finished" Game (I have to come back to it at some point), and my first one on Unity (God bless C#).

This one was made between March-June 2024, during heavy school time. It represents a fond milestone for me and also a highlight on 3 big mistakes:

1.Wasting time
2.Overthinking
3.Not thinking enough about deployment

I am not particularly on good terms with Google Developer Console. It is unfair for us indie devs, I literally got stuck on the requirements of the 12 beta testers at the time, and by the time I had them, I had run into many issues. I know releasing apps must have a strict control and standards but it is abusive. God willing, next time I will create an LLC in order to avoid that hassle.

That is my recommendation to anyone that sees this one: <h2>Don't run, fail quick, have fun, and make sure to always keep smiling, no time to worry, just to live and program.</h2>
