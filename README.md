My second "Finished" Game (I have to come back to it at some point), and my first one on Unity (God bless C#).

This one was made between march-june 2024, during heavy school time. It represents a fond milestone for me  and also a highlight on 3 big mistakes, 1.wasting time, 2.overthinking and 3.not thinking enough about deployment. 

I am not particularly on good terms with google developer console. It is unfair for us indie devs, I literally got stuck on the the requirements of the 12 beta testers at the time, and by the time I had them, I had run into many issues, I know releasing apps must have a strict control and standards but It is abusive, God willing next time I will create an LLC in order to avoid that hassle.

That is my recommendation to anyone that sees this one, don't run, fail fast, have fun, and make sure to always keep smiling, no time to worry, just to program.
